About Me
Currently I'm a digital nomad, I love traveling and discovering new experiences.
I'm freelancing as a game audio producer,making sound and music and holding the joy of seeing a game comes to a sonic life.

Alongside that I'm in a deep learning process of:

â€¢ Game design(Game psychology,environment design,creating 2D assets) and 

â€¢ Audio development(JUCE framework and C++)

**IMPORTANT** 

So if you're:

â€¢ Looking to hire a C# programmer that specialize with Unity(5 years of experience).

â€¢ Having a project that looks for audio production or just need help with your game audio.

â€¢ Got any game jams, meetups, other game industry activity or games related events

**Don't hesitate to contact, I love games and completely enthusiast about finding new interesting projects.**
