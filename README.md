I'm freelancing as a game audio producer,making sound and music and holding the joy of seeing a game comes to a sonic life.
I've been doing music since ever and I'm a huge fan of foley , sound design and post production.
As part of my passion to game I've been exploring the field of game audio at the past 7 years.
Working with:
Unity, Unreal, Cubase, Ableton, Fmod, Wwise, Game Maker and keep learning new approaches to sound through technology.
