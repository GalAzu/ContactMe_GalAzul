Hey I'm Gal Azulay, a game developer, sound engineer, music producer and mainly a game audio producer at the past 6 years.
I'm games enthusiast and was operating with Microsoft and organizing game jams in their hub under Universe Project name.
Here you can find some of my work that I programmed as a solo developer.

Currently I'm a digital nomad, freelancing from doing music, sound and any kind of audio solution to games.
Alongside that I'm in a deep learning process of game design and audio development(C++)

So if you're:
• Looking to hire a C# programmer that specialize with Unity(5 years of experience).
• Having a project that looks for audio production or just need help with your game audio.
• Got any game jams, meetups, other game industry activity or games related events

**Don't hesitate to contact, I love games and completely enthusiast about finding new interesting projects.**
